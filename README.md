# Python-Batch-Image-Converter
This is a Python program to batch convert images. Place the python program in the folder containing images to convert and execute it. Note that the program tries to find images recursively in the directory in which it is placed and therefore all the images including the ones in the subdirectories will be converted and saved in the new target folder meanwhile preserving the directory structure of the input source directory. 

Python Pillow Library is needed for this to work. To install Pillow execute the follwing code in your terminal :
```
pip install Pillow
```
You can convert files to and from formats specified below:
